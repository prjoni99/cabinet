/// both can reach. This is that: a small list of games and a folder of
/// cover images inside the shared app group.
///
/// Deliberately its own type rather than sharing the Apple TV's
/// TopShelfSnapshot. The shapes look alike but the needs differ, the shelf
/// wants a 1x and 2x poster pair sized for a television while a widget
/// wants one image per game sized for a phone, and folding them together
/// would mean refactoring a shipped feature to serve an unshipped one.
/// Worth revisiting once both have settled.
