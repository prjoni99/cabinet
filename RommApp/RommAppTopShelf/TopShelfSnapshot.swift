/// What the app leaves behind for the top shelf extension to read.
///
/// Compiled into both targets, which is why it lives in the extension's
/// own folder rather than in `RommAppTV/`: the extension is a separate
/// process and cannot see the app's files, so this is the one piece of
/// code both sides genuinely share. It deliberately depends on nothing
/// but Foundation. The extension links no part of the app, not `Session`,
/// not the models, not a core, and this file is what keeps that true.
///
/// The split between where the list lives and where the images live is
/// not arbitrary, it is the tvOS file system:
///
/// - Inside a shared app group container, **only `Library/Caches` is
///   writable**, and everything in it is purgeable by the system at any
///   time. That is where the posters go, because an image is
///   regenerable and a purged one heals the next time the app runs.
/// - Real persistent storage on tvOS is 500KB of `UserDefaults` and
///   nothing else. That is where the list goes, because the list is what
///   must not vanish. Eight entries of an id, a title and a filename is
///   a kilobyte or two, and the app shares that budget with
///   `TVProfileStore`, so this stays deliberately small: no summaries,
///   no platform metadata, no anything the shelf does not draw.
