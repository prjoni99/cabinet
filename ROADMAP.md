# Roadmap

Where Cabinet is headed. This is not a changelog, see
[Releases](https://github.com/MMagTech/cabinet/releases) for what has
already shipped. Nothing here is a promise or a deadline, this is a
weekend project worked on as time allows, but it is the real direction,
not a wishlist that gets ignored.

If something here interests you, or you want to pick one up, open an
issue or a discussion first so the approach can be talked through before
any code gets written.

## Being explored

Not committed, not scoped, real conversations that happened and are
worth having in the open.

- **More systems, running natively.** Cabinet compiles twenty-three
  emulators into the app, and each new one is a core to build plus a
  control layout to draw. Everything originally listed here is done:
  Atari 2600, Vectrex, 3DO, Virtual Boy, Nintendo DS and Game & Watch,
  plus PSP, which this file previously listed as impossible.

  What is left, and the honest state of each:

  | System | Core | Notes |
  |---|---|---|
  | ColecoVision | Gearcoleco | Ready to go, but needs its BIOS on your server first |
  | Intellivision | FreeIntv | Its disc controller and keypad are the hard part |
  | Magnavox Odyssey<sup>2</sup> | O2EM | Keyboard-adjacent controls |
  | Philips CD-i | SAME_CDI | Experimental upstream, lowest priority |

  Beyond those the runway is genuinely short, and shorter than it looks,
  because PSP was on the wrong side of this list until it shipped.
  PlayStation 2, GameCube, Wii, 3DS, Switch and Vita all need runtime
  code generation Apple does not permit, or hardware beyond what an
  interpreter can carry. PSP turned out not to: PPSSPP's own interpreter
  is fast enough without it, which is upstream's claim and now Cabinet's
  measurement too. That is worth remembering before writing anything
  else off.

- **Download a whole platform on the Mac.** A phone keeps a handful of
  games; a desk machine has the disk for all of them. The idea is a
  single action on a platform, "Download All", that keeps every game
  the Mac can play from that system, the way Music downloads an album
  rather than a song at a time. It would say the count and the total
  size before it starts, queue the files one after another rather than
  all at once, and stay cancellable. It would take every game Cabinet
  can keep, playable here or not: an unsupported platform's files are
  still worth having for another emulator, which is already how a
  single download works. Built for the Mac the same day it was noted,
  2026-09-02, and for the phone the day after: there the files come
  down through the system's own background downloader, over Wi-Fi
  only, so a platform started at the table finishes with the phone
  locked in a pocket, and a queue the system quit the app in the middle
  of carries on at the next launch. Both waiting on a release.
- **Play Together, two screens.** Two or more devices each running the
  same game, with only the button presses crossing the house Wi-Fi,
  so each person plays on their own screen: two phones with no
  television, two rooms, a friend on a hotspot. A maybe, deliberately.
  Two people on one screen already works, a TV or a Mac running the
  game with phones as the controllers, and that covers most game
  nights; this adds the two-screen case at the cost of the largest
  piece of work on this list and a mechanism that stays delicate after
  it ships, since a dropped packet pauses everyone and only the cores
  that compute identically on two machines can take part. The design
  is settled if the need arrives: seats rather than two players, the
  existing pairing wire as the transport, lockstep with a short input
  delay, and a "syncing players" beat when two machines fall out of
  step. Decided 2026-09-04 not to build ahead of a real need.
- **Picture tiers per machine.** The picture settings that hold sixty
  frames on the fastest Mac here were tuned there, and a slower machine
  drops frames on the same settings. The idea is three named bundles of
  settings, Performance, Balanced and Quality, and a way for each machine
  to land on its own: measured once in the lab for machines in the room,
  and for any other machine a half minute of watching its own frame
  times the first time a heavy core runs, stepping down or up and
  remembering the answer for that chip. A chip nobody has met yet, next
  year's, would simply stay at Quality unless it had to step down.
  Explored 2026-09-03 and deliberately not built: it would sit in the
  launch path every core shares, and there is no machine here that is
  either too slow at the defaults or wasting headroom to test it
  against. It gets built when one exists.
- **A native touch control restyle.** The current on-screen controls are
  functional but read a little flat next to the rest of the app. A
  restyle direction has been discussed, not built.
- **A real loading screen on tvOS for large downloads.** Built
  2026-09-20. A game over a hundred megabytes that is not already on
  the Apple TV gets the whole screen while it comes down, the cover in
  the centre with a real bar and "340 MB of 1.2 GB" under it, and Back
  stops the download and returns to the launch screen. Anything
  smaller, every cartridge, keeps the quick inline behaviour, the Play
  button's own label carrying the wait, since that is under a second on
  a home network and a full screen would only flash. Waiting on a
  release.
- **Multi-disc games.** Waiting on a real one. It would need `.m3u`-style
  disc swapping in the player, which the libretro cores already
  understand, and any disc system could meet it, PlayStation and Saturn
  most often. As of 2026-09-03 the library it is built against has no
  multi-disc game on any platform, so there is nothing to build it
  against or test it with. It gets built when one arrives, not before.
- **Settings syncing across your devices via iCloud.** No confirmed real
  need yet, just an idea that comes up alongside the pairing work above.
- **Light guns on the console systems.** The gun works on the arcade
  cabinets, and the aim it uses lives entirely in the phone and knows
  nothing about which core is running, so the console systems inherit it
  for free. What is missing is games to point it at. Research on which
  cores take a gun and on which port is already done.

## Known rough edges

Things that work but waste effort, with a known fix rather than an open
question.

- **The BIOS gets downloaded more often than it needs to be.** A
  platform's firmware comes down once per game on Apple TV, and on
  iPhone once per launch for any game you have not kept. Kept games
  already do the right thing: firmware is shelved in one folder per
  platform and nothing is downloaded at launch. The fix is to point the
  other two paths at that same shelf, so the pattern already exists in
  the code. Nothing is broken, and a BIOS is small next to a CD game,
  but across a full arcade library it adds up to a few hundred megabytes
  of redundant downloads and duplicated cache. A second, smaller part of
  the same fix is only downloading firmware the platform's core actually
  uses, rather than everything the server lists for it.

A few ideas got explored just as seriously and reached a real answer
instead of an open question. Those live in
[docs/settled.md](docs/settled.md) rather than here: a native macOS build,
uploading a ROM from Cabinet, Atari Jaguar as a native core, and skipping
setup on a new device via iCloud.

What Cabinet doesn't do today, rather than what it might do next, is in the
[README](README.md#what-doesnt-work-yet) instead of here.
